<h3>Preview of Final 2022.1.0a7 Release Notes</h3>

<h4>Features</h4>

<p>2D: Added support for Color channel in SpriteShape so usage of Vertex Colors is possible in SpriteShape.</p>

<p>Android: Users can include custom asset packs into the build, by adding assets to the directory ending with '.androidpack'.</p>

<p>Android: When building Android App Bundle with Split App Binary enabled, Unity will create asset packs.</p>

<p>Editor: Added new menu entry under Help to display Third Party Notices for the Unity Package Manager.</p>

<p>Graphics: Added a new Texture Mode called Static to the LineRenderer, TrailRenderer and ParticleSystem Trails.</p>

<p>Graphics: Added a new Texture Scale option to the LineRenderer, TrailRenderer, and ParticleSystem Trails.</p>

<p>Graphics: Added MSAA depth resolve Vulkan support.</p>

<p>Graphics: Added RayTracingAccelerationStructure.ClearInstances C# API.</p>

<p>Package: Ability for clients of searcher window to filter and prioritize search results as they need.</p>

<p>Package Manager: Added documentation links to feature's included packages when it's customized or manually modified.</p>

<p>Package Manager: See an error message when I don't have the proper rights to use an entitled package.</p>

<p>Package Manager: User will be able to see the packages' supported platforms once this is implemented in the backend.</p>

<p>Package Manager: We want to see the E icon in the package item when the license is Granted or Not granted in a closed network.</p>

<p>Physics: Added the ability to generate Delaunay meshes for specific 2D Colliders. This option will generally produce simpler meshes with fewer primitive physics shapes for better overall performance. Added "PolygonCollider2D.useDelaunayMesh", "TilemapCollider2D.useDelaunayMesh" &amp; "CompositeCollider2D.useDelaunayMesh".</p>

<p>Shaders: Added an option to use strict shader variant matching in the player.</p>

<p>Undo System: Explorable undo history UI.</p>

<p>Version Control: - Plastic: Added support for inviting other members. This option is available from the gear / settings icon.</p>

<p>Plastic: Added support for signing in with Cloud Edition. This is available during the onboarding screen if you have never signed in.
Plastic: Added support for turning off Plastic in their project. This option removes the Plastic metadata from your directory. This option is available under Assets &gt; Plastic SCM &gt; Turn off Plastic SCM
Plastic: Added notification on the Plastic SCM tab title to indicate incoming changes. Users will no longer need to have the Plastic SCM window visible to know there are incoming changes.
Plastic: Auto configuration of SSO
Plastic: Added date column in incoming changes.
Version Control: Added auto sign in when logged into Unity account.</p>

<h4>Improvements</h4>

<p>2D: Added support for Build Only SpritePacking in SpriteAtlas V2.</p>

<p>2D: Cache internal reflection to speed up Sprite editing data access.</p>

<p>2D: Improved Console log to display all affected Sprites.</p>

<p>2D: Improved performance of RuleTile caching.</p>

<p>2D: Sprite outline shape calculation is faster now (Sprite.Create, or importing sprite textures), especially for large textures.</p>

<p>2D: SpriteAtlas Cache max Size should be Project Settings instead of Preferences.</p>

<p>2D: Updated 2D URP template starting folder structure for better clarification of usage.</p>

<p>2D: Updated Skinning Editor tooltips text.</p>

<p>Android: Added boot-config/command-line switch "platform-android-cpucapacity-threshold" that can be used to specify which CPU cores are treated as big cores. The cpu capacity is a value in the range between 0 and 1024. A capacity value of 870 yields the same behavior as before the fix for case 1349057.</p>

<p>Android: Builds will fail early and with a human readable error message, when Unity project is located in path with Non ASCII characters. Android Tools like clang don't work correctly when operating in paths with non ascii characters and the error is not very clear, thus Unity will provide a better error message. (1340631)</p>

<p>Android: Bump Android Logcat package to 1.2.3.</p>

<p>Android: Improved WebCamTexture when using Vulkan on Android devices that support VK_ANDROID_external_memory_android_hardware_buffer.</p>

<p>Asset Pipeline: Clarified the behaviour of Resources.Load() in the Scripting API documentation.</p>

<p>Asset Pipeline: Do not assert on race when receiving import worker results for a deleted asset.</p>

<p>Asset Pipeline: Improved opening time of Import Activity Window. (1343709)</p>

<p>Asset Pipeline: Improved upload and download path.</p>

<p>Asset Pipeline: New diagnostic setting to enable writing of asset database events to Logs/AssetDatabase.log. This log file can assist when troubleshooting asset importing.</p>

<p>Audio: DSPGraph: Changed mixer thread scripting runtime attachment assertion to a warning, to better reflect the intent of the message.</p>

<p>Build Pipeline: Made copying of assemblies part of the incremental player to save time on subsequent builds.</p>

<p>Build Pipeline: Make error messages about microphone or camera usage more visible.</p>

<p>Build Pipeline: Reference documentation improvements in area of Build Pipeline.</p>

<p>Documentation: Improved Scripting API docs page for RayTracingAccelerationStructure. Added See Also section.</p>

<p>Editor: (Dynamic Hints) If the target window of a Dynamic Hint is available but unfocused, it becomes focused before the Dynamic Hint is shown.</p>

<p>Editor: EditorStyles.iconButton is now public so custom editor windows can implement help, settings and other icon buttons.</p>

<p>Editor: Improved Editor responsiveness when a large number of textures are selected in the Project Browser.</p>

<p>Editor: Improved mac editor process guard in order to catch all types of exceptions and early handle cases where the ADB process might have already shut down.</p>

Renamed preference "Update Units Automatically" to "Update Nodes Automatically".
Package Manager: Changed error and warning box to look like the info box.</p>

<p>Package Manager: The Git LFS cache enabled by setting the UPM_ENABLE_GIT_LFS_CACHE environment variable is now always located under the global cache root, even when the cache root location is customized.</p>

<p>Package Manager: We are no longer using SCSS files, only USS from now on.</p>

<p>Package Manager: We now cache whether each asset version is a full project or not after clicking Import on it for the first time.</p>

Now, "Dont Care" corresponds to the render target being filled with arbitrary data at the beginning of the frame, which may be faster in some situations. Note that there are no guarantees for the exact content of the render target, so projects should use "Dont care" only if they are guaranteed to render to, or otherwise write every pixel every frame.</p>

<p>URP: When MSAA is enabled and a depth texture is required, the opaque pass depth will be copied instead of scheduling a depth prepass.</p>
