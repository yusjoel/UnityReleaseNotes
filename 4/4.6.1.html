        <h3>Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>WebPlayer: Added support for 64 bit Mac OS X browsers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Improvements</h3>

<ul>
<li>AssetBundles: Added additional information about WWW.LoadFromCacheOrDownload.</li>
<li>Graphics: Improved performance when allocating memory for large numbers of temporary objects.</li>
<li>Graphics: Optimized culling of lights in a mostly deferred scene with a few forward-rendered objects.</li>
<li>Physics 2D: Added 'Static Collider Shapes' to profiler for 2D physics.</li>
<li>Physics 2D: Renamed Physics2D.deleteStopsCallbacks to Physics.changeStopsCallbacks to better represent its purpose (old property is now obsolete).</li>
<li>Serialization: Randomize fileIDs for objects in prefabs to lower the chance of merge conflicts.</li>
<li>UI: Encapsulate children mesh bounds when calculating Root Bounds. Also cache the value so we don't calculate every time we draw.</li>
<li>UI: Performance optimizations. Optimized UI batching, text rendering and reduced amount of editor-only allocations.</li>
<li>UI: Standalone input module now leaves keyboard selected object selected. Mouse and Keyboard input are now orthogonal. Clicking with the mouse will move selection to the clicked element.</li>
<li>Windows Phone/Store Apps: Profiler shows managed memory usage.</li>
<li>Windows Phone/Store Apps: Provide ArrayList.BinarySearch implementation.</li>
<li>Windows Standalone: You can now embed windows standalone player into another application, simply pass -parentHWND and windows standalone application's window will be created with specified parent. See Command line arguments documentation for more information.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Documentation: Styling changed to match website design, switch links between Manual and Script Reference are working now.</li>
<li>Windows Phone: Disabled shadows on Adreno 305 devices due to driver issues.</li>
