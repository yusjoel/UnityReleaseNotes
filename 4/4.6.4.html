<li>Windows Store Apps: Increased timeout when checking assembly compatibility.</li>
<li>Windows Store Apps: Use exception log type for exceptions now.</li>
<li>Windows Store Apps/Windows 8.1: When creating D3D backbuffer, Unity will take width/height from SwapChainPanel component instead of CoreWindow, SwapChainPanel's offset from CoreWindow will also be taken into account.</li>
<li>Windows Store Apps/Windows Phone 8: Fixed a memory leak, which was occurring in various places. For e.g., in physics collision callbacks such as OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision).</li>
<li>Windows Store Apps/Windows Phone: Better error message when AssemblyConverter fails to resolve type.</li>
