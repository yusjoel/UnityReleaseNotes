        <h3>Improvements</h3>

<ul>
<li>Android: Apply DeviceDefault theme if available, respect user's theme.</li>
<li>Animation: Better formatting of the error message when animation events are fired (i.e: "oldWrappedTime &gt; newWrappedTime").</li>
<li>UI: Allow dragging anchors outside of bounds of parent when holding down Ctrl (Cmd on Mac) - the same key that disables snapping. This makes it easier to author screen transitions that support multiple resolutions, since content can be animated to move a distance that's a percentage of the screen width or height.</li>
<li>UI: Avoid rebatching when moving a Nested Canvas.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Android: Apply Holo or Material theme explicitly instead of DeviceDefault.</li>
<li>Android: Apply user theme if set.</li>
<li>Android: Fixed Auto target graphics mode on devices which think they support ES 3.0 without proper hardware.</li>
<li>Android: Fixed crash in Mono caused by invocation of wrong method.</li>

<li>iOS/Android: Fixed a crash with MSAA depth render textures.</li>
<li>iOS/IL2CPP: Added a null terminator to string arrays when they were marshaled.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>iOS/IL2CPP: Allow il2cpp.exe to work correctly if there is a space in the installation path.</li>

<li>Fixed socket I/O requests getting stuck in ThreadPool on POSIX/iOS.</li>
<li>Fixed ThreadPool not re-using idle worker threads (lead to potentially very high memory consumption and bad performance).</li>
<li>Fixed ThreadPool upper thread count limits being very low; now roughly the same as on Mono.</li>

<li>iOS/IL2CPP: Forward declare empty types (created to end infinite recursion) that are used as method arguments.</li>
<li>iOS/IL2CPP: Generate C++ code which will compile when a nested generic passes the maximum depth for recursive nested generics.</li>
<li>iOS/IL2CPP: Handle 4D arrays.</li>
<li>iOS/IL2CPP: Handle custom attributes with generic types and arrays of generic types.</li>
<li>iOS/IL2CPP: Handle delegate invoke with nested delegates where the method which is invoked on the outer delegate is a static method.</li>
<li>iOS/IL2CPP: Implemented Assembly.CodeBase by returning the value of AssemblyName.Name.</li>
<li>iOS/IL2CPP: Make Activator.CreateInstance work for arrays.</li>
<li>iOS/IL2CPP: Match the behavior of the Mono scripting backend by not stripping the Animation code from the engine when code stripping is enabled.</li>

<li>UI: Caret on InputField now blinks at proper frequency.</li>
<li>UI: Clamp setting canvas group alpha between 0-1 on API call.</li>

<li>UI: Fixed nested masking not getting the correct stencil value and failing.</li>
<li>UI: Only do cut, copy, paste, and select all if holding down just Ctrl (Cmd on Mac), not if additional modifier keys are also held down. This prevents these actions from happening when intending to type characters that use Ctrl (Cmd on Mac) as part of the key combination.</li>
<li>UI: Prevent out of range exception that happened in InputField under certain circumstances due to an unwanted recursive call.</li>
<li>UI: UI items now work with Scene View searching.</li>
<li>WebPlayer: Fix crash when when elementType was queried from uninitialized elementClass.</li>
<li>Windows Phone 8: Uppercase first letter in InputField.</li>
<li>Windows Store Apps: Build&amp;Run disabled when using Unity CSharp projects.</li>
<li>Windows Store Apps: Fixed problems with build from editor when C# projects are enabled.</li>
<li>Windows Store Apps: Fixed deadlock when resizing window.</li>

<li>Windows Store Apps:Touch position will be correctly transformed when SwapChainPanel doesn't occupy full screen.</li>
<li>Windows Store Apps/Windows Phone 8: When unloading unused assets or switching to another scene, prefabs will be correctly reloaded and won't loose references. Previous behavior was - sometimes textures, mono behaviors, etc in prefabs would be lost, this would result for e.g., in textures not showing up in objects instantiated from prefabs.</li>
<li>Windows Store Apps/Windows Phone: Fixed NullReferenceException in SerializationWeaver.</li>
<li>WWW: Fixed incorrect HTTP status 100 when POST data was relatively large.</li>
