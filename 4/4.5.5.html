        <h3>Improvements</h3>

<ul>
<li>Editor: Added additional logging when the MonoDevelop script editor was opened on OSX.</li>
<li>iOS: Added support for iPhone 6 &amp; iPhone 6 Plus.</li>
<li>iOS: Display the number of finished files in AOT cross-compile progress bar.</li>
<li>Linux: Implemented screen-fullscreen command line option.</li>
<li>OSX: Implemented show-screen-selector command-line option.</li>
<li>Physics: Show inspector warning when a 2D collider removes generated collision shape(s) because they fail verification. This supplements the existing warning when no collision shapes are present.</li>
<li>Shaders: Improved performance of importing complex surface shaders (with many multi_compile directives).</li>
<li>Shaders: Improved performance of shader compilation for OpenGL platforms.</li>
</ul>

<li>Core: Fixed the "Failed to initialize unity graphics" error when using the -no-graphics flag in OS X</li>
<li>Direct3D 11: Unity will now correctly fall back to no MSAA depth textures if the GPU does not support ones with MSAA.</li>
<li>Documentation: Fixed rendering for richText.</li>
<li>Editor: Fixed word wrapping in the detail area of the console.</li>
<li>Editor: Handle an intermittent failure in CoCreateInstance during the Visual Studio launch process.</li>

<li>Editor: Don't pass out incorrect PropertyHandler on first call to GetHandler.</li>
<li>Flash : Empty project no longer has (harmless) errors in the log.</li>
<li>OpenGL ES 2: Fixed issues with native plugin called in OnPreRender .</li>
<li>Graphics: Send kGfxDeviceEventInitialize to native plugins if renderer changes.</li>
<li>Graphics: Fixed light culling with custom projection matrix.</li>
<li>Image Effects: Fixed Image filters targeting a render texture when a camera doesn't clear the color buffer.</li>

<li>Manual: Update documentation for player command line arguments.</li>
<li>Mecanim: Fixed trigger parameter consumption when used by multiple layers.</li>
<li>OSX: Now GameKit is loaded dynamically, it should help with Mac App Store submissions for games, which are not using Game Center.</li>
<li>OSX: Application.persistentDataPath changed from ~/Library/Caches/ to ~/Library/Application Support/</li>
<li>Physics: 'OnMouseDown' and 'OnMouseUp' callbacks for 3D physics now don't take priority over 2D physics, they can run simultaneously.</li>
